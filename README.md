# codestory

Write stories in your code :)

### Usage:

    cd to/your/source/directory's/parent
    codestory src    # assuming codestory is in the path
    firefox codestory/document.html

`document.html` is stored in the system generated `codestory/` folder
which houses other essential files for the html file to work.

### How to use?

This package comes with a `sample` folder. Invoke `codestory` on the folder,

    codestory sample
    firefox codestory/document.html

View the document and see the content of the files
and observe which parts of the text get mapped to the html
document and how do they look.
